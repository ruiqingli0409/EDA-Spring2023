3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.


## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project"


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: ENV710 Applied Statistical Modeling for Environmental Management with Dr.Betsy Albright

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: Data Visualization is the part I did best last semester in 710; I really appreciate the hybrid natural of this class which gives me chances to go back to the material and review at my own convenience.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: Data Cleaning process. I always was provided with clean data set so this is completely new to me; Time manage is also something I need to wrok on, and watching recordings prior to class is new to me and I need to get used to that. But I do think this is a more efficient way of learning.


## 3) GitHub
